# ✈️ 05: Airbus A380-800 Full Aircraft Model (External Surface Reconstruction)

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, large-scale CAD project replicating the **external geometry** of the **Airbus A380-800** (Superjumbo) using **Autodesk Fusion 360** . The primary focus was a difficult **surface reconstruction** challenge: accurately modeling the complex fuselage and wings by referencing limited-dimension 3-view drawings.

## Scope and Methodology

* **Software Used:** **Autodesk Fusion 360**
* **Modeled Components:** Full fuselage, main wing surfaces (fixed part only), and horizontal/vertical stabilizers.
* **Excluded Components:** To focus the scope on large-scale surfacing, the model **does not** include mechanical assemblies or high-lift devices such as **engines, ailerons, rudder, elevators, spoilers, flaps, slats, vortex generators, doors, windows or landing gear.**
* **Surface Reconstruction from Limited Data:** The model was built by importing and calibrating **3-view drawings (canvases)**, overcoming the lack of detailed dimensional data.
* **Advanced Surfacing Techniques:** The continuous, complex surfaces were created using sophisticated techniques, including **Loft**, **Sweep**, **Intersect**, and **Cut** operations to generate the primary airfoils and fuselage shape.

## 🔬 Material Specifications
